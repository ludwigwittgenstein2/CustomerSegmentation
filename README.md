About Data-Set:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This dataset contains household level transactions over two years from a group of 2,500 households who are frequent shoppers at a retailer. It contains all of each householdâ€™s purchases, not just those from a limited number of categories. For certain households, demographic information as well as direct marketing contact history are included.

Below is the link for whole data-Set:
