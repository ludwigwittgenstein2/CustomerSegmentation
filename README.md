# Supermarket
We build a Django prototype in Python to improve revenues for Supermarket data.

Our Dataset has information about product details, purchases, demographics, coupons. Using this, our goal is to improve revenues by targeting Segments in the Dataset.

We use dunnhumby's data for a Supermarket.

___________________________________________________________

#### Data Set:

This dataset contains household level transactions over two years from a group of 2,500 households who are frequent shoppers at a retailer. It contains all of each householdâ€™s purchases, not just those from a limited number of categories. For certain households, demographic information as well as direct marketing contact history are included.

Below is the link for whole data-Set:

* [CSV-Files]  (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6lz05ehkt31x81j/AADxV_STvuCwDujql3VwarGja?dl=0)
* [YAML-FILES](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lz522q4z2119vh2/AACtNhemZOf4EtCojHccSHBBa?dl=0)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DATA TABLES:
The following contains the structure of the Dataset, which we used for the whole prototype.

We use (a) to denote that a record is connected to another table.

--------------
##### CAMPAIGN_TABLE
(1584 households mailed 30 Campaigns)

This table lists the campaigns received by each household in the study. Each household received a different set of campaigns.
File: campaign_table.csv
```
HOUSEHOLD_KEY -- Uniquely identifies each household

(a)CAMPAIGN_TABLE -- Uniquely identifies each campaign. Ranges 1-30

DESCRIPTION -- Type of campaign(TypeA, TypeB or TypeC )
```

--------------
##### CAMPAIGN_DESC
This table gives the length of time for which a campaign runs. So, any coupons received as part of a campaign are valid within the dates contained in this table.
(30 Campaigns)

*File: campaign_desc.csv*
```
(a)CAMPAIGN -- Uniquely identifies each campaign. Ranges 1-30

DESCRIPTION -- Type of Campaign(TypeA, TypeB, TypeC)

START_DAY -- Start Date of Campaign

END_DAY -- End Date of Campaign
```

--------------
#####  COUPON_REDEMPT
(434 households redeemed 556 coupons from 30 Campaigns)

This table identifies the coupons that each household redeemed.

*File: coupon_redempt.csv*


```
HOUSEHOLD_KEY -- Uniquely identifies each household

DAY -- Day when transaction occurred

COUPON_UPC -- Uniquely identifies each coupon

CAMPAIGN -- Uniquely identifies each campaign

```

--------------
#####  COUPON
(1135 coupons promoted 44133 products for the 30 campaigns)

This table lists all the coupons sent to customers as a part of a campaign, as well as the products for which each coupon is redeemable. Some coupons are redeemable for multiple products. One example is a coupon for any private label frozen vegetable.

For campaign TypeA, this table provides pool of possible coupons. Each customer participating in a TypeA campaign received 16 coupons out of the pool. The 16 coupons were selected based on the customer's prior purchase behavior. Identifying the specific 16 coupons that each customer received is outside the scope.

*File: coupon.csv*

```
CAMPAIGN -- Uniquely identifies each campaign. Ranges 1-30

COUPON_UPC -- Uniquely identifies each coupon( unique to household and campaign)

PRODUCT_ID -- Uniquely identifies each product

```

*File:product.csv*

```
PRODUCT_ID -- Number that uniquely identifies each product

DEPARTMENT -- Groups similar products together
